# ServiceNow-Apps

<h1>CIPHER</h1>

<p> CIPHER is available to download here: https://share.servicenow.com/app.do#/detailV2/32027fdb13eb820057ce58222244b0a9/overview </p>

Password encryption/decryption is an important feature and ServiceNow should have a native tool to facilitate this.
CIPHER leverages the MD5 Digest algorithm to encrypt/decrypt passwords. 
No longer store passwords in your knowledge base or worknotes as plain text.
